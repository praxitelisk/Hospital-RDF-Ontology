# Hospital-RDF-Ontology

This repocitory contains a list of RDF files that express and describe with the aid of an RDF language for a generic Hospital using Protege 3.5. Moreover it contains a small list of sparql-quirries to quirry the individuals for the Hospital who follows the RDF language. The whole idea was for a project during my postgraduate studies with supervisor - professor Dr. Nick Vasileiadis, Associate Professor, http://lpis.csd.auth.gr/people/nbassili/
